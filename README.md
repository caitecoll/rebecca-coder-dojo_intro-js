Your Project
------------

On the back-end,
- For the purposes of our class, we're going to ignore this part of the project. Just know that these files are important, and our website won't work without them.

On the front-end,
- views/index.html: HTML is the skeleton of our website. This is the file where we will add the content that we want our users to see.
- public/style.css: CSS is what controls how our website looks. In this file we can modify our colors, fonts and what is visible to our users.
- public/client.js: Javascript allows our website to be dynamic and interactive for our users. In our project, this is the file that controls what happens when a user clicks one of the buttons on our website.
- assets: This is where we can store any files we want to use in our website, like images or music
